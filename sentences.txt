Without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend
Experiments have corroborated her predictions
His friend corroborated his guilt
His charming air arrested my attention
He raised his hat in salutation
He did not deign to an answer
Don't fix your eyes on the girls, that's not polite
The sight of the battlefield was horrible
She faints at the sight of blood
He has taken leave of me
Let's take leave of the topic and turn to another
She shows great readiness to learn
He agreeably consented to my wishes
They greeted us with civility
My principal concern is my family's welfare
It is a dangerous plan, one you'll have to follow up on your own account
No one can hum him to draw his attention
On seeing her mother, the little began to cry
My dad will drop me off on his way to work
I came here on purpose to see you
I came here on purpose so as to inform you of my intended departure 
He's a real gentleman, if a little pompous at times
The new law has received the royal assent
He wandered in to see me as if he had nothing else to do
The poke of her black bonnet hide her face from him
This dress is made of muslin
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike
He asked me to inquire after you
Every one bowed as the Queen walked into the room
You can't keep up the pretence any longer
Tourists crowded the pavement
He was accustomed to command, not to entreat
He has secured two commissions to design buildings for a local authority
The Marine Corps began to slim down under budget restrictions
